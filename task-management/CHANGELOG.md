# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **A keyboard for the board, and a command palette.** The dashboard was mouse-only —
  cards moved by HTML5 drag and nothing else. `j`/`k`/`h`/`l`/`g`/`G` move a cursor,
  `1`–`5` move the focused card to that column (the number is printed in the column
  heading), `[`/`]` reorder within a column, `x` selects, `w` watches, `o`/`Enter` opens,
  `c` creates, `/` searches, `?` lists everything. `⌘K`/`Ctrl-K` opens a palette over
  every board action and every visible task. Cards became real focusable list items with
  `aria-label`s and a roving tabindex, so `Tab` and `j`/`k` agree. Shortcuts stay quiet
  while you type or while a dialog is open, and no modifier chord except `⌘K` is
  intercepted. Keyboard reordering needed no drag-and-drop library: `[`/`]` call the same
  `rank` endpoint the drop gesture already called.

- **`tm why <id>`** — why a task is not startable, walked to the root of its dependency
  chain rather than one hop deep. Reports the reason at each hop (a parked blocker's
  written reason, a claim another session holds, a hand-written `tm block`, the WIP limit,
  a dependency cycle, a `blockedBy` pointing at nothing) and names the work at the bottom
  as `roots`. `parked` is reported but not counted as blocking, because `tm start` resumes
  a parked task. Also available over MCP as `tm_why`.
- **`tm graph`** — the dependency graph as Mermaid, fenced so GitHub renders it inside a
  PR diff. `--epic` scopes it (blockers from outside the epic are still drawn, since they
  still explain the block), `--all` includes done work, `--raw` drops the fence, `--json`
  gives `{nodes, edges}`.
