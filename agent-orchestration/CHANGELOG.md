# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - Unreleased

- Add dual Claude Code and Codex plugin manifests.
- Add bundled MCP and CLI launcher contracts.
- Add cross-provider orchestration and diagnostic skills.
- Add Claude-native orchestration agent and optional Codex custom-agent template.
- Define the stable `ao_*` lifecycle, routing, event, cleanup, and approval surface.
- Require explicit absolute `consumerCwd` for consumer-grounded and mutating operations.
- Add deterministic capability-aware routing, the max-effort adversarial architecture protocol,
  repository-derived worktrees, durable hash-chained state, readiness probes, and atomic scheduling.
- Add Bubblewrap-enforced write containment, cooperative/verified cancellation, journal recovery,
  architecture decision lifecycle gates, installed-cache lifecycle coverage, and declarative provider
  command descriptors.
- Isolate provider roots, environments, devices, runtime sockets, and networks; outbound provider
  traffic uses `slirp4netns` with host loopback disabled.
- Add explicit one-shot/persistent session contracts, fail-closed follow-up eligibility, validated
  protocol DAGs, concrete MCP output schemas, terminal evidence immutability, periodic recovery,
  and nonce-owned exact-path worktree cleanup.
- Add bounded authenticated ACP readiness for every provider (including Kimi), fresh unmounted broker
  control directories, dependency-scoped protocol evidence, executor/contract registration gates, and
  retryable cleanup for process groups whose ownership cannot be proven.
- Run workers and sandboxed readiness probes inside transient systemd user scopes so timeouts, close
  failures, and leader exits cannot orphan provider descendants.
- Deny ACP client-side filesystem/terminal callbacks, omit credential-bearing proxy variables from
  sandbox argv, and require an active-scope worker acknowledgement before spawn returns.
- Replace persistent host credential mounts with per-turn bootstrap copies that are visible only to
  one constant, permission-denied broker authentication turn, then truncated and unlinked before the
  first task-controlled prompt.
- Restrict bootstrap inputs to auth-only files in broker-owned tmpfs; expose them as exact read-only
  mounts beneath otherwise writable provider homes whose ancestors are nested mountpoints; mount
  scratch directly at a sandbox top-level; and disable Claude user, project, and local setting sources.
- Admit only canonical provider executables beneath provider-specific installation roots, including
  fixed-command resolver support for version-manager shims; gate
  pipelined ACP prompts behind exact session responses; bound frames, transports, request buffers,
  and stderr; and add cgroup, runtime, core-dump, task-count, memory, and per-file ceilings.
- Scope run authority to the exact consumer checkout so linked worktrees cannot inspect or control
  one another, and revalidate provider-specific executable roots again at sandbox execution time.
