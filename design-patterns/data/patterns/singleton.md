tradeoffs:

  - Pattern name becomes more important than the problem force.

  - Behavior parity at the public boundary.
  - Variant or flow-specific edge cases.

# Singleton

## Intent
Ensure one logical instance exists and provide controlled access to it.

## When To Use
- A resource is truly unique within a process and must be coordinated.
- The lifecycle is explicit, testable, and safe under concurrency.
- Global access is less harmful than passing the dependency everywhere.

## Avoid When
- The instance is only convenient global mutable state.
- Tests need parallel isolation.
- Dependency injection or explicit ownership would clarify lifecycle.

## Language Notes

### csharp
Prefer DI singleton lifetimes; static singletons should be rare and immutable.

### java
Enums are safe for simple singletons; Spring singletons are often the better lifecycle owner.

### typescript
Module scope already creates single-instance behavior in many runtimes.

### python
Module-level objects are usually clearer than metaclass singletons.

### go
Use package-level state sparingly and guard initialization with sync.Once when needed.

### rust
Use OnceLock or LazyLock for explicit one-time initialization.

### cpp
Use function-local statics carefully and avoid global teardown surprises.

## Forces
- Keep the variation point explicit without spreading conditionals or construction knowledge through callers.
- Preserve domain names and dependency direction while making behavior easier to test in isolation.
- Balance indirection against the simplicity of language-native functions, modules, records, or interfaces.

## Tradeoffs
- Improves local change isolation, but can add indirection that obscures straightforward code.
- Creates better test seams when behavior truly varies, but can fragment logic when the variation is small.
- Works best when the abstraction is named after the domain role rather than the pattern label.

## Failure Modes
- Introducing the pattern before the variation point is stable enough to justify a boundary.
- Leaking host object state into collaborators until the design becomes harder to reason about.
- Naming production types after generic pattern roles instead of domain concepts.

## Testing
- Test through the behavior boundary that callers actually use.
- Add focused tests for each variant, construction path, or collaboration rule introduced by the pattern.
- Preserve behavior with parity tests before deleting old branches or constructors.

## Observability
- For runtime-selected variants, log the selected domain strategy, factory path, state, or collaborator role at debug or trace level.
- Avoid noisy pattern-level logs; surface only decisions that help diagnose production behavior.
- Add metrics only when the pattern changes runtime routing, cost, latency, or failure behavior.

## Implementation Notes
- Introduce Singleton at the smallest boundary where variation, construction, or collaboration changes independently.
- Prefer idiomatic language features before adding class-heavy structure.
- Keep public behavior stable first, then simplify old conditionals or construction paths once tests prove parity.
