tradeoffs:
  - Adds explicit structure and vocabulary for the force.

  - Pattern name becomes more important than the problem force.

  - Behavior parity at the public boundary.
  - Variant or flow-specific edge cases.

# Builder

## Intent
Separate the construction of a complex object from the representation that is produced.

## When To Use
- Construction has many optional parts, validation steps, or ordering constraints.
- The same assembly process should produce different representations.
- A readable construction DSL would reduce call-site noise.

## Avoid When
- The target object has only a few obvious constructor parameters.
- The builder allows invalid intermediate states to leak.
- Named arguments or records already solve the readability problem.

## Language Notes

### csharp
Records, optional parameters, and object initializers may be enough; use Builder for validation-heavy flows.

### java
Common for immutable objects; consider records for simple data carriers.

### typescript
Prefer typed config objects for simple cases; use fluent builders when staged validation matters.

### python
Dataclasses and keyword arguments usually cover simple cases; use builders for staged workflows.

### go
Functional options are often the idiomatic Builder variant.

### rust
Builder is common for complex structs; encode required fields through types when worth it.

### cpp
Use fluent builders or parameter objects while preserving move semantics.

## Forces
- Keep the variation point explicit without spreading conditionals or construction knowledge through callers.
- Preserve domain names and dependency direction while making behavior easier to test in isolation.
- Balance indirection against the simplicity of language-native functions, modules, records, or interfaces.

## Tradeoffs
- Improves local change isolation, but can add indirection that obscures straightforward code.
- Creates better test seams when behavior truly varies, but can fragment logic when the variation is small.
- Works best when the abstraction is named after the domain role rather than the pattern label.

## Failure Modes
- Introducing the pattern before the variation point is stable enough to justify a boundary.
- Leaking host object state into collaborators until the design becomes harder to reason about.
- Naming production types after generic pattern roles instead of domain concepts.

## Testing
- Test through the behavior boundary that callers actually use.
- Add focused tests for each variant, construction path, or collaboration rule introduced by the pattern.
- Preserve behavior with parity tests before deleting old branches or constructors.

## Observability
- For runtime-selected variants, log the selected domain strategy, factory path, state, or collaborator role at debug or trace level.
- Avoid noisy pattern-level logs; surface only decisions that help diagnose production behavior.
- Add metrics only when the pattern changes runtime routing, cost, latency, or failure behavior.

## Implementation Notes
- Introduce Builder at the smallest boundary where variation, construction, or collaboration changes independently.
- Prefer idiomatic language features before adding class-heavy structure.
- Keep public behavior stable first, then simplify old conditionals or construction paths once tests prove parity.
